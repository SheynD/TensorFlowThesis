# Dependencies and Tools
In order to run the code, you must have TensorFlow installed locally. The installation instructions can be found at https://www.tensorflow.org/install/ based on the machine that you are currently using. Either GPU and CPU versions can be installed or just CPU. Note that the GPU and CPU installation will be more computationally expensive and running with multiple threads could be much slower. If you have a slow CPU and low amounts of RAM, this could even drop off to not running at all...
